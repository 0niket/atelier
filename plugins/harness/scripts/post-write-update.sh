# Post-Write Update Hook
# Updates state after code written, runs tests

# This is a placeholder - full implementation would:
# 1. Detect what was written (test vs implementation)
# 2. Update state TDD phase if test written
# 3. Run affected tests
# 4. Update state coherence status
# 5. Detect code smells

# For now: pass through
