# Pre-Write Check Hook
# Validates state machine and TDD compliance before writing code

# This is a placeholder - full implementation would:
# 1. Load state file for current feature
# 2. Check if file being written matches currentTask.filePath
# 3. Validate TDD phase (if red phase, must be writing test)
# 4. Block if writing wrong file or wrong phase

# For now: pass through
exit 0
