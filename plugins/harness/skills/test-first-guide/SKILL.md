Guide Test-Driven Development cycles (Kent Beck principles).

## TDD Cycle Guidance

**Red Phase**:
- Suggest next test to write
- Reference spec acceptance criteria
- Ensure test fails before continuing

**Green Phase**:
- Suggest minimal implementation
- Apply TDD patterns (Fake It, Obvious Implementation)
- No premature optimization

**Refactor Phase**:
- Trigger when green achieved
- Suggest refactorings if smells detected
- Maintain green tests

Maintain test list, track coverage of acceptance criteria.
